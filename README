A port of ChucK to Ruby!
Do things you'd do in ChucK in Ruby!
A very, very minor subset of such things

Work in Progress:
- No live speaker output
- Very, very few UGens, and no UAnas
- Probably not stable (but the examples work!)

But there's WAV output! (woot)

Small TODO:
- Make Linkages more efficient (they're so slow)
- Add Events

Big TODO:
- Live audio

Comparison
==========

  ChucK:

    SinOsc s => dac;
    5::second => now;
    
    // then listen to your speakers

  Ruck:

    require "ruck"
    include Ruck
    include UGen
  
    spork do
  
      wav = WavOut.new("out.wav")
      SinOsc.new(440) >> wav >> blackhole

      play 5.seconds

    end
    
    // then listen to out.wav when it's done

... so there's obviously a lot of work to do ...
        ... isn't programming fun?!
