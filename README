A port of ChucK to Ruby!
Do things you'd do in ChucK in Ruby!
A very, very minor subset of such things

Work in Progress:
- No live speaker output
- Very, very few UGens, and no UAnas
- Probably not stable (but the examples work!)

But there's WAV output! (woot)

TODO:
- Add Events
- Live audio (see audio/)
- Multi-channel support on WavOut (and then dac)
- Compressor, limiter

Comparison
==========

  ChucK:

    SinOsc s => dac;
    5::second => now;
    
    // run "chuck script.ck"
    // then listen to your speakers

  Ruck:

    SinOsc.new(440) >> WavOut.new("out.wav") >> blackhole
    play 5.seconds
    
    # run "ruby ruck.rb script.rb"
    # then listen to out.wav when it's done

... there's obviously a lot of work to do ...
       ... isn't programming fun?!
